Please add your pseudocode to this file
And a written explanation of your solution

We are finding all possible consecutive pieces of a string, starting from each position and going through every possible end position. 
For example the word cat = 
    1. "c", "ca", "cat"
    2. "a", "at"
    3. "t"

Pseudo code:

Function consecutiveSubstrings(string):
  1. Create an empty array
  
  2. Loop through each starting position from 0 to end of string:
     a. Loop through each ending position from i+1 to length of string:
        - Find substrings at each position
        - Add substring to result array
  
  3. Return result array
